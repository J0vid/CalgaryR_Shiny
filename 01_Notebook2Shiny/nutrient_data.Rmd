# Here's our starting notebook analysis of the Health Canada nutrient dataset

```{r libraries and data importing}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(DT)

# What's in this Rdata file: save(ca_conversion_factor, ca_food_choices, ca_food_group, ca_food_name, ca_food_source, ca_measure_name, ca_nutrient_amount, ca_nutrient_name, ca_nutrient_source, ca_refuse_amount, ca_refuse_name, ca_yield_amount, ca_yield_name, daily_value, file = "nutrient_data.Rdata")

load("nutrient_data.Rdata")
```

We've got our data loaded, now what do we want to know?

```{r explore the structure of the data}

ca_food_group


```

```{r what does my daily coffee look like?}



```
